4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays


Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

My runtime and memory were pretty bad.
My solution is basically going through both at the same time, right?
And just appending the smaller of the two first.
Kind of like a "zipper".

Lastly, get the length of the array, and from that, the median.
Bc we don't know till we know the length, right?

Another way would be to sum the two lengths.
So we know that, for [1,2] and [3, 4], the total length will be 4.
Thus, we must get the values that correspond to the 2, 3 values.
Then we must go slowly up through both at the same time, choosing the smaller of the two elements.
Until we count to the median values.
At most, you'd go through half+1 of the elements.

Bc there's no way to know, if I drop at the middle of any of the two
If I should go up or down by a lot.
Might as well choose to start at the beginning.
