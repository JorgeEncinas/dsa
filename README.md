# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository will contain code and notes about Data Structures, Algorithms, and Leetcode.

## Why?

It feels like you have to make progress every single day. And that progress must reflect somewhere.
Being able to see myself take steps, however small, brings me some comfort.

## Future

I don't know if this approach will work. There's plenty of sources for learning these things out there.
I'm still not even sure this is the best way to approach Leetcode.
I'll find out in due time.
Do reach out if you have a suggestion, I'll be thankful for it.
